Collate
=======

Collate is an extremely simple text templating system. It allows you to create a library of named blocks of text, and to insert those blocks in other blocks using that name. There is no logic, variables, or conditionals, and it will panic if you try to create a circular include. It expects you to know its limits, and to use it for simple tasks. If you do, you will be rewarded with simple and fast text collation.
